Portfolio Item Copy
===================

## Overview

Find all the child items from a root Portfolio Item and replicate as much as possible into a new item that
might be in the same or different workspace.

Portofolio item names might differ so the app tries to use the ordinal level of the item instead.

## TODO

1. Add the source FormattedID to the destination item in the notes field or add a discussion entry.
2. Collate revision history and add as an attachment
3. Check model equality between source and destination
3. Find all dependencies are re-create them
4. Find all Milestones and re-create them
5. Copy all tags over
6. Copy over timeboxes
7. Add custom field mapping
